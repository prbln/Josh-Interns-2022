Cherrypicking is the concept of adding commits made in another branch to our own branch.
============================
It is used in two cases

1) when we accidently make changes to a branch that were intended to be made in another branch.
2) if we want to add specific changes or commits done by another person to our own branch 

It is useful for testing and fixing bugs , restoring changes made and when it is not possible to merge a branch completely due to
some issues.
=============================
Steps of cherrypicking-

1) note the commitid that we want to include in our branch by using the command  git log
2) checkout to the branch in which we want to include the commit
3) now use the command git cherry-pick <commitid>
