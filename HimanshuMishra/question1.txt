Cherry Pick 
As the name suggests cherry pick is used to selectively pick and merge the commits in the head branch 
With the "cherry-pick" command, Git allows you to integrate selected, individual commits from any branch into your current HEAD branch.
For example if in my branch himanshu I have C1 ,C2,C3 ,C4 and we want to merge only c1 and c2 in our main branch then we can use cherry pick
 for this purpose

the command to do it is

git cherry-pick bd0123

where bd0123 is the SHA identifier of the commit .

Cherry pick creates a duplicate commits when we integrate our commit into our main branch

Steps to use cherry -
1. note the identifier of the commit you want to merge
2. checkout to head branch repository
3. use git checkout commitid command to merge the commits
