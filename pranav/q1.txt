Q1 : - git cherry-pick is a powerful command that enables arbitrary Git commits to be picked by reference and appended to the current working HEAD. 
Cherry picking is the act of picking a commit from a branch and applying it to another. 
git cherry-pick can be useful for undoing changes. 
For example, say a commit is accidently made to the wrong branch. 
You can switch to the correct branch and cherry-pick the commit to where it should belong.
branch tree must be clean and must have a last sucessful commit
Example - a - b - c - d   Main
          \
           e - f - g Feature
In is this scenario we want to commit f in main so we use git cherry-pick in branch main and this copies the commit in the main branch.
Commands - 
	git checkout main
	git cherry-pick f
After execution - 
a - b - c - d - f   Main
         \
           e - f - g Feature

The f commit has been successfully picked into the main branch
