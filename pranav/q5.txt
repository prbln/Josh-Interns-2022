q5 : git push --force makes changes in the remote repo and forcing the changes to be made i.e. the changes made by other contributors is overlooked.
It overlooks the history and makes the changes.
git push --force-with-lease makes changes in the remote repo but not forcefully changing without overlooking the history and considering other contributors commits too.
When to Use Force with Lease
Assuming a regular push does not work, one does not need to use force if they are doing decent day-to-day work. 
Every day-to-day need is satisfied with force-with-lease. These include any sort of a rebase, particularly:
Rebase a branch onto another branch,
Rewording a commit in the past,
Squashing a few commits together,
Reordering the commits, or
Changing the author of a previous commit.


When to Use Force
When doing something nasty. This includes:
Removing a commit together with its contributions from history,
Removing a large file that was accidentally committed from history,
Removing a folder from the repo together with all its history.
